## Project Architecture

### Core Components
- `app.py`: Flask application initialization with database configuration
- `csv_data_service.py`: CSV data processing and filtering engine
- `routes.py`: Web endpoints for filtering, status checking, and results display
- `models.py`: Database models for filter requests and caching
- `templates/`: HTML templates with Bootstrap dark theme
- `static/`: CSS and JavaScript assets

### Data Processing Flow  
1. **Input**: User submits company name and LinkedIn URL filters via simplified interface
2. **CSV Processing**: CSVDataService loads and filters 2,559 profiles from attached CSV
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Applies company matching, LinkedIn URL validation, and duplicate removal
4. **Category Search**: Users select job title categories or enter custom titles for targeted filtering
5. **Ranking System**: Results ranked by relevance scores based on title matching algorithms
6. **Executive Inference**: Special handling for CEO/Founder searches with incomplete data
7. **Caching**: Results stored in PostgreSQL for 30-day cache validity
8. **Display**: Filtered results with dynamic job title search and download options

### Filtering Logic
- **Company Matching**: Exact company name and LinkedIn URL correlation  
- **Duplicate Removal**: Name and company-based deduplication for unique results
- **Job Title Categories**: 12 predefined categories with expanded keyword matching
  - Executive, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Finance, Operations, HR, Product, Design, Data, Consulting, Management
- **Custom Title Search**: Manual title entry with category expansion algorithms
- **Relevance Ranking**: Scoring system for exact matches, partial matches, and keyword relevance
- **Executive Role Inference**: Includes profiles with perfect company matches but missing titles
- **Position Field Fallback**: Checks position field when other title fields are empty

## Database Schema
- `filter_request`: Stores filtering parameters and cached results
- Supports JSON result storage with 30-day cache validation
- PostgreSQL with connection pooling and pre-ping health checks

## User Preferences
